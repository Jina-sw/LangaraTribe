# What It Does
A social web platform for the school community where students write blogs, view a course list, explore existing clubs and read news.
Designed for langara students 

# Tech Stacks
- MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js, Pug, REST APIs (Stock image API)
- Vercel

# Accompliments we are proud of
This brought us not only loads of tears but also lots of laughterüòè We challenged ourselves to successfully implement the features we planned even though this was our first team full stack web development project. Personally (Jinah), this app is my first time implementing REST APIs for auto-generated random images and CRUD features for blog writing with the utilization of a NoSQL database. 

# Future Improvements
There are some empty buttons for a place-holding purpose. These should be filled with real features and functionalities.
